                <h3>Love of Learning</h3>
                <div class="coreblurb">
                    <p class="blurb">Curiosity has always been my compass. As a kid, I turned summers into a time for knowledge—STEM camps, math acceleration, and language immersion. By high school, I was tackling French and Spanish side by side, later dabbling in Italian and Japanese - though my fluency never caught up with my enthusiasm. Now, as a consultant in entrepreneurship and economic development, my learning never stops. I dive deep into venture capital, go-to-market strategies, workforce development, and beyond—collecting insights, making connections, and translating knowledge into action.</p>

                <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                <div class="coreblurb">
                    <p class="blurb">From early days of Sudoku and Tetris to Tango and Queens on LinkedIn, problem-solving has always been second nature. I see challenges as puzzles waiting to be cracked. Whether it’s identifying gaps in the startup ecosystem or learning from other cities’ innovations, I love iterating on solutions. With a foundation in tech, product management, and entrepreneurship, I’ve built a habit of spotting inefficiencies and crafting approaches that make sense—always thinking about the real-world application.</p>

                <h3>Social Impact</h3>
                <div class="coreblurb">
                    <p class="blurb">I once dreamed of designing assistive technologies to empower people with disabilities. That vision evolved, but the core reason never changed. My software engineering career began in healthcare technology, but it was through listening to friends-turned-entrepreneurs that I found my path—supporting those building something from nothing. Now, I work to clear pathways for founders, ensuring the barriers that once seemed insurmountable become stepping stones to success. Because when businesses thrive, communities do too.</p>

                <h3>Turning Complexity into Clarity</h3>
                <div class="frameblurb">
                    <p class="blurb">I work within a lot of complexities, and to do that work with others, I use 
                        visuals. When breaking down intricate topics like product management or software development, I instinctively would search for analogies and diagrams to make concepts digestible. Over time, this habit has led me to create my own visuals—refining not just the content but the way it’s communicated. Now, my drawing skills - thanks Figma! - are evolving to keep up with the ideas I want to bring to life, ensuring others can follow along and engage with the insights I share.</p>

                <h3>Building while Documenting</h3>
                <div class="frameblurb">
                    <p class="blurb">Documentation isn’t an afterthought—it’s part of how you build. From my early days as a software engineer to every role since, I’ve developed a habit of writing things down as I go or right after I’ve finished a task. Whether it's product specs, process guidelines, or capturing insights mid-execution, this practice keeps projects aligned and easy for others to collaborate. It’s a skill that’s the backbone of how I translate ideas into actionable steps.</p>

                <h3>Being Iterative & Adaptive</h3>
                <div class="frameblurb">
                    <p class="blurb">Having a North Star is more important than planning every step. The path to execution is shaped by the environment, opportunities, and feedback along the way. Working in startups has reinforced this mindset—what works today may shift tomorrow, next week or next month. By staying agile, listening to stakeholders, and adjusting strategies as needed, I’ve embraced an approach that leads to unexpected insights, stronger outcomes, and exciting opportunities.</p>
